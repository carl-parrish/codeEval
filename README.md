# Code Exercises
When I was learning Python I started a practice of trying to do all the exercises on [Code Eval](http://www.codeeval.com) in python. Since then whenever I'm learning a new language (or evaluating how well I understand one) I run thur these exercises in the new language. Over the years I've used many other sources besides CodeEval but I've kept that the name of the repo.
